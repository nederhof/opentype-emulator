# opentype-emulator

Quick and dirty tool in Python to help understand complicated sets of substitution rules in OpenType.

Only a small part of OpenType has been implemented, 
and what has been implemented may not handle all cases correctly.
In particular, I am aware that chained substitution rules do not comply with the 
intended semantics and positioning rules are not implemented correctly
at all.

## Getting started

See `example.py`.
